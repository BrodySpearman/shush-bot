# shush-bot

Using javascript along with the discord.js API, I created this voice channel bot on a rainy day, primarily to annoy my friends. 
As soon as this bot is initialized and in a server, a user can type 'sh'(*any amount of 's's and 'h's will suffice*) along with a mention of another user. 
The bot joins the voice channel and will shush the other user while they are talking by using the voice detection in the api.
